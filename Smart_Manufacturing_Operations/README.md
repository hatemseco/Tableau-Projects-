# Smart Manufacturing Operations Dashboard

## Overview
This Tableau dashboard monitors operational performance in a smart manufacturing environment using production, quality, and network metrics. The objective is to evaluate efficiency, identify operational risks, and support real-time decision-making for manufacturing operations.

## Key KPIs
- Total Operations
- Average Production Speed (units/hour)
- Average Defect Rate (%)
- Average Error Rate (%)
- Average Network Latency (ms)
- Average Power Consumption (kW)

## Key Insights
- Production speed remains stable over time, with Active operation mode consistently outperforming Idle and Maintenance modes.
- Defect and error rates are lowest during Active operations and increase during Maintenance periods, indicating higher operational risk.
- Network latency remains low and stable, supporting reliable real-time manufacturing performance.
- Power consumption is consistent across operation modes, suggesting efficient energy utilization.
